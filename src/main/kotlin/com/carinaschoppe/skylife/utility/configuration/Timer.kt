/**
 * A configuration class that defines various timing constants used throughout the plugin.

 * This class follows the singleton pattern to provide consistent timing values
 * across different parts of the plugin. It contains predefined durations (in seconds)
 * for different game phases and mechanics.
 *
 * @property LOBBY_TIMER The duration (in seconds) players wait in the lobby before the game starts. Default: 60 seconds
 * @property INGAME_TIMER The maximum duration (in seconds) of a game round. Default: 900 seconds (15 minutes)
 * @property END_TIMER The duration (in seconds) of the end-game phase before returning to the lobby. Default: 10 seconds
 * @property PROTECTION_TIMER The duration (in seconds) of the initial spawn protection. Default: 10 seconds
